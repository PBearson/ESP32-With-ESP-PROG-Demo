# ESP32-With-ESP-PROG-Demo
Debug your embedded software with ESP32, ESP-PROG, and JTAG. This project is part of a course at University of Massachusetts Lowell, and some details may need to be changed to work for other readers.

## Overview

The ESP32 supports the JTAG debugging interface, which can allow users to debug their embedded applications much like they would a normal Windows/Linux executable. For instance, JTAG allows users to place breakpoints in code, view the memory stack, view registers, and more. However, most ESP32 boards on the market do not contain the required hardware for communicating with an external JTAG adapter. This hardware can be found on chips such as FT2232HL, which is implemented by the ESP-PROG. Other technical details will be spared here. You may refer to Espressif's guides on [JTAG debugging](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html) and [ESP-PROG](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-iot-solution/en/latest/hw-reference/ESP-Prog_guide.html) for more information on these topics.

See below for a look at how our custom ESP32 board may connect to ESP-PROG:

The purpose of this project is to show users how to pair the ESP-WROOM-32 development board with the ESP-PROG device. We will use the command line interface for this demo. We will use the `hello world` sample project in this repository, compile it, upload it, and perform some debugging all through the ESP-PROG debugger board.

## Hardware Setup

You will need the following hardware to complete this project:

* A Hiletgo ESP32-WROOM-32 development board
* ESP-PROG
* 1 USB cable
* At least 6 male-to-female jumper wires

ESP-PROG contains a 10-pin header which allows wiring to the JTAG interface. For reference, each pin on the header is numbered in the figure below:

To wire the ESP32 to the ESP-PROG, use the table below as a guide. Note that four of the pins on the headers will go unused.

| **ESP-PROG pin** | **ESP32 pin** |
| - | - |
| 1 (VDD) | 5V |
| 2 (TMS) | 14 |
| 3 (GND) | GND |
| 4 (TCK) | 13 |
| 5 (GND) | - |
| 6 (TDO) | 15 |
| 7 (GND) | - |
| 8 (TDI) | 12 |
| 9 (GND) | - |
| 10 (NC) | - |

To connect the devices to your host computer, you can connect the ESP-PROG to the computer directly via a USB cable. You do not need to connect the ESP32 to your computer directly. It will receive power from the ESP-PROG via the VDD pin. The JTAG interface also enables programming capabilities for uploading the application to the ESP32, so there is no need to connect to the UART controller on the development board.

## Software Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have ESP-IDF installed on your computer.

Download this repository with the following command:

```
git clone -b command_line https://github.com/PBearson/ESP32-With-ESP-PROG-Demo.git
```

After connecting your devices to the computer, make sure your Operating System can see the USB controller (FTDI). In VirtualBox, you should attach the following USB controller to your virtual machine:

* **Devices -> USB -> FTDI Dual RS232-HS**

Now it is time to get the application ready so we can debug it. Navigate to the _hello_world_ directory. Run the following command to build the app:

```
idf.py build
```

Now use JTAG to upload the app to the board. To do this, we will use OpenOCD, a software that can communicate with ESP-PROG (and many other adapters) to access the JTAG interface. Run the following command to program the ESP32:

```
openocd -f board/esp32-wrover-kit-3.3v.cfg -c "program_esp build/hello-world.bin 0x10000 verify exit"
```

If the command succeeds, you will see output showing the binary was uploaded to the board and verified. See below for reference:

## Testing JTAG

GNU Debugger (GDB) is a popular open-source debugging tool for software applications. Espressif have updated GDB to recognize the Xtensa architecture, which is used by the ESP32. We can quickly start a GDB session using the following command:

```
idf.py openocd gdb
```

If the above command does not launch the GDB session, you may need to press the **EN** button on your development board first, and then try the command again. I personally found that sometimes the output will stop on the message "Hardware assisted breakpoint 1 at ..."

### Place a breakpoint

Breakpoints are useful for observing the state of your program at a specific time (for example, before or after a function is executed). The following command places a temporary breakpoint on line 31 of the active file, i.e., __hello_world_main.c__.

```
thb 31
```

![Place Breakpoint](images/breakpoint.JPG)

The breakpoint is temporary because it is deleted once the program reaches it. You can place permanent breakpoints by replacing __thb__ with __hb__. 

We can see that the program continued running ("Continuing") until it hit the breakpoint ("Thread 1 hit ..."), at which point it halted and returned control to the GDB session.

To continue running the program, simply run the following command:

```
c
```

### Read the stack frame

The call stack holds important information about a program's local variables and subroutines. A stack is divided into frames. To learn information about the currently active subroutine, one way is to look at its stack frame. This can be done by running the following command:

```
i f
```

![Read Stack Frame](images/stack_frame.JPG)

We can see here that the program gives us several details, including:

* The current program counter (PC), i.e., the address of the currently active instruction
* The saved PC value, i.e., the return address
* The current stack pointer (SP), i.e., a pointer to the top of the stack
* The previous SP value, i.e., the value of SP in the previous function
* The address and values of any arguments
* The start address of any local variables
* Saved CPU registers.

### Read the registers

The CPU registers can also provide lots of information about the state of the program. To view the registers, run the following command:

```
i r
```

![Read Registers](images/registers.JPG)

There are actually many more registers that the previous command does not show. For example, the ESP32 actually contains 64 general purpose registers (labeled AR0 - AR63), but a subroutine can only access 16 of them at a time (labeled A0 - A15). To read all registers, you can run the following command:

```
i all
```
